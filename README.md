## ci-cd-automated-docker-builds  

I use the docker images created by [jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz) pretty often. Recently the docker image on [jess dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jess/chrome) stopped updating so I decided to build and host my own at [cluelesstechnologist99 dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cluelesstechnologist99/chrome).  

In this repo I will keep all dockerfiles that are hosted under my repo at dockerhub.
